**Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game!**

This is my first take in JavaScript.

Everything that I've done and deployed in this Github account has all been pure HTML and CSS with the only exception of the "Lap Counter" I made
with very little JavaScipt.

This project is meant as a means for me to practice and exercise my understanding of JavaScript and manipulating the DOM through JavaScript. Designs are made by myself as well.

Creating this game challenged me in making my thought process as well as the way I code a bit more parallel to each other. In the past, it was a little hard to
keep up with what I think I want to do and translate that into functional and reusable code, but through this project I was able to improve my coding skills
and process at par to my thought process.

Game objective: Win a race to five game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer!

**Enjoy and have fun playing a classic game!**
